### About me




I'm Zach. I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and I'll be graduating from the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs (UCCS) in May of 2016. 


Apart from being a software developer, I'm also an audio engineer and a musician. Most of my time is put towards my classes, my work at Northrop Grumman, and side projects; but I also work part-time as a live sound audio engineer, mixing bands for audiences in the thousands. At home, I find time to record and mix solo artists who don't have the money to pay a studio to do their record. 

Other hobbies of mine are playing soccer, reading about new sciences and technologies, reading philosophy (mostly Sartre and Nietzsche), biking, and also bouldering and hiking on the nearby mountain.
