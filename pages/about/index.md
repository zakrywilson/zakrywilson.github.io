### About me

I'm Zach. I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and I'll be graduating from the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs (UCCS) this May. 

I'm very passionate about computer science. Most of my time is devoted to side projects when I'm not busy doing homework or writing code at Northrop Grumman. My interests in the computer science realm have shifted among a few subjects such as machine learning and NLP, big data, GUI development, and high performance computing. It's been difficult for me to drop all other computer science interests and focus solely on one specific skill; but as of lately, my focus has been in high performance computing and machine learning.

### My hobbies

Apart from being a software developer, I'm also an audio engineer and a musician. I also work part-time as a live sound audio engineer, mixing bands for audiences in the thousands. At home, I find time to record and mix solo artists who don't have the money to pay a studio to do their record.

Other hobbies of mine are playing soccer, reading about new sciences and technologies, reading philosophy (mostly Sartre and Nietzsche), biking, and also bouldering and hiking on the nearby mountain.

### My goals

What is life without goals? I've always had large goals as a kid – from wanting to be a professional soccer player for [Manchester United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.) to producing music with [Doctor Luke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Luke). 

My goals have obviously shifted since my teenage years: now my ultimate goal is to work for [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX), and I am firmly set on this goal. My dream is to be part of the first team to put people on Mars – I cannot think of anything more worthwhile. Unfortunately, SpaceX does not recruit college students from UCCS. Their recruiting methodology entails only pulling from the top schools in the world, so unfortunately I don't stand much of a chance until I get some more work experience under my belt. 

Until then, I've been enjoying exploring my other interests. I would love to work for a startup where I would be able to work with multiple languages and technologies, and where I would be able to see my product being used in the real world.

### Conclusion

So that's a little about me. If you would like to keep in touch, my email and social media is listed at the top of this page. I'm also currently in search of a new job so if your company has any available positions, I'd love to hear about them.
