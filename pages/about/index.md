### About me


I'm Zach. I recently graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs (UCCS) this May, and began working at [a.i. solutions](http://www.ai-solutions.com/) in Colorado Springs as a Software Engineer. 


I'm very passionate about computer science. Most of my time is devoted to side projects when I'm not at work. My interests in the computer science realm have shifted among a few subjects such as machine learning and NLP, big data, GUI development, and high performance computing. It's been difficult for me to drop all other computer science interests and focus solely on one specific skill; but as of lately, my focus has been in high performance computing and machine learning.


### My hobbies


Apart from being a software engineer, I'm also an audio engineer and a musician. I also work part-time as a live sound audio engineer, mixing bands for audiences in the thousands. At home, I find time to record and mix solo artists who don't have the money to pay a studio to do their record.


Other hobbies of mine are playing soccer, reading about new sciences and technologies, reading philosophy (mostly Sartre and Nietzsche), biking, and also bouldering and hiking on the nearby mountain.


### My goals


I've always had large goals as a kid – from wanting to be a professional soccer player for [Manchester United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester\_United\_F.C.) to producing music with [Doctor Luke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr.\_Luke). 


My goals have obviously shifted since my teenage years: now my ultimate goal is to work in aerospace in the pursuit of exoplanet colonization. This means I aim to work for a company like [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX) or even NASA if their Orion project goes well. I am firmly set on this goal of contributing to space exploration. My dream is to be part of the first team to put people on Mars – I cannot think of anything more worthwhile.


### Conclusion


So that's a little about me. If you would like to keep in touch, my email and social media is listed at the top of this page. I'm also always open to new opportunities and I'd love to hear about them.
