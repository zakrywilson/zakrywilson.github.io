## Before 

So before lambda expressions you had to explicitly override the single method. Doing it once isn't much of a problem but when you get a bunch of action listeners in your class, it starts to get pretty cluttered.

## After

Now, thanks to lambda expressions, if the interface only requires one method to be implemented, you can use a lambda expression. It looks much cleanerâ€¦ and I love not having the `@Override` annotation.

See! Way cleaner.
