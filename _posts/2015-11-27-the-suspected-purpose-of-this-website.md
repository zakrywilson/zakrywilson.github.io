## What to do...
Now that I have this website, the question is what do I do with it. I thought that I'd use it for a couple things. Since I have so many interests, I'm hoping to incorporate a few of these---e.g., audio engineering, music composition, and especially software. 

## Software
I've always had a love for software, ever since I was a kid. I was probably like you---screwing around with the computer, changing everything you can, breaking things, and learning how to fix them. When I switched from music to computer science, I began to lose interest in those various aspects. My focus is almost entirely on computer science now, and I want to share my experiences, discoveries, and interests with whoever is interested.

## Audio engineering
In 2012 I became certified as an audio engineer at Citrus College. For my time during school, I worked for Tim Jaquette, learning a ton while working alongside him for a lot of this projects. After graduating, I worked for a year at New Life Church in Colorado, working for Evan Duran doing live sound. I've since then quit to focus more on computer science.

## Music composition
I spent a large portion of my life writing music---generally solo piano works. Life has gotten in the way of my compositions in recent years, but I plan to write much more once I have finished college.

## Now then...
I'm no genius in any of these categories, but I hope to be of help or interest.

### Enjoy
